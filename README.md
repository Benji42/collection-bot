## How to run

1. Install `docker` and the `docker-compose` plugin.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the `TOKEN` variable with your token and `GUILD` with a private guild the bot is in. The other variables can stay the same.
3. Run the command `docker compose up`.
4. Once the bot starts, use the `/populate` command in your private guild.
